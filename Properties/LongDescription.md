## Plop the Growables
- **Disables growable building zone checks** - you can place growable buildings anywhere, and they won't despawn (be condemned) if the zoning underneath them is changed.
- Optionally **Disable building level changes for user-selected individual buildings**
- Optionally **Disable building level changes for manually plopped growable buildings**
- Optionally **disable building level changes for ALL buildings**
- Toggle level-locking (on/off) for all existing buildings

### Disables growable building zone checks
This means that you can place them anywhere (using the dev UI) - on zoning, off zoning, partially on zoning, on incorrect zoning, wherever - and they won't despawn.

This allows the manual placement of growable buildings directly, without needing any workarounds such as making them signature buildings.

Note that buildings will still require road access (including for water/sewerage/electricity) to function properly, but they don't have to be perfectly aligned with the road.

### Disable level changes for individual buildings
This mod adds a 'lock building level' toggle to the building info panel for growable buildings.  Select this toggle to keep that building at the same level.

Note that building level-up progress within the current level will still show on the building's level up progress panel, but it will never reach the level required to upgrade to the next level.

### Lock building levels when plopped (optional)
Automatically applies level locking to any growable building that is manually placed (plopped) while this setting is active.  This includes placement via Find It, Line Tool, or the dev mode prefab menu.

### Disable ALL building level changes (optional)
This can be toggled in the mod's options panel (the default is **off**).  When this is enabled all growable buildings will keep their current level, ensuring that they also keep their appearance.

Note that building level-up progress within the current level will still show on the building's level up progress panel, but it will never reach the level required to upgrade to the next level.

### Toggle level locking for all existing buildings
This is available via the buttons in the options panel to either **lock** or **unlock** levels for all buildings currently on the map.  These are only enabled when you're in-game (as otherwise there's no buildings to toggle).

## How to select and place growable buildings
This mod doesn't have its own UI - instead, use TDW's **Find It** mod to select and place growable buildings (or use the game's developer mode).
