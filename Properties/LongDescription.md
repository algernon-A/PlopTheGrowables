A very simple mod that disables growable building zone checks.  This means that you can use the game's inbuilt dev tool to plop growable (spawnable) buildings wherever you want and without regards to zoning.

Note that if you place a growable building away from a road and then draw the road to it it won't automatically connect to pipes or power.  Either draw the road first and *then* place the building, or use Quboid's excellent Move It mod to move the building into place.

Thanks to TPB, the creator of the original Plop the Growables mod for Cities: Skylines 1.
