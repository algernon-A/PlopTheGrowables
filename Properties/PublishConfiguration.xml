  <LongDescription>## Plop the Growables
- **Disables growable building zone checks**
- Optionally **disable building level changes**

### Disables growable building zone checks
This means that you can place them anywhere (using the dev UI) - on zoning, off zoning, partially on zoning, on incorrect zoning, wherever - and they won't despawn.

This allows the manual placement of growable buildings directly, without needing any workarounds such as making them signature buildings.

Note that buildings will still require road access (including for water/sewerage/electricity) to function properly, but they don't have to be perfectly aligned with the road.

### Disable building level changes (optional)
This can be toggled in the mod's options panel (the default is **off**).  When this is enabled all growable buildings will keep their current level, ensuring that they also keep their appearance.
