  <ShortDescription Value="Stops growable buildings being condemned if they're outside the correct (or any) zone." />
  <LongDescription>A very simple mod that disables growable building zone checks.  This means that you can place them anywhere (using the dev UI) - on zoning, off zoning, partially on zoning, on incorrect zoning, wherever - and they won't despawn.

This allows the manual placement of growable buildings directly, without needing any workarounds such as making them signature buildings.

Note that buildings will still require road access (including for water/sewerage/electricity) to function properly, but they don't have to be perfectly aligned with the road.

Thanks to TPB, the creator of the original Plop the Growables mod for Cities: Skylines 1.</LongDescription>
