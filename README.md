## Plop the Growables
A mod for Cities: Skylines 2.  Available for download only on [Paradox Mods](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/75826/Windows).

The primary platform for support is the [Cities Skylines Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/HTav7ARPs2).

### Features
- **Disables growable building zone checks**
- **Disable building level changes for user-selected individual buildings**
- Optionally **disable building level changes for ALL buildings**

### Disables growable building zone checks
This means that you can place them anywhere (using the dev UI) - on zoning, off zoning, partially on zoning, on incorrect zoning, wherever - and they won't despawn.

This allows the manual placement of growable buildings directly, without needing any workarounds such as making them signature buildings.

Note that buildings will still require road access (including for water/sewerage/electricity) to function properly, but they don't have to be perfectly aligned with the road.

### Disable level changes for individual buildings
This mod adds a 'lock building level' toggle to the building info panel for growable buildings.  Select this toggle to keep that building at the same level.

Note that builing level-up progress within the current level will still show on the building's level up progress panel, but it will never reach the level required to upgrade to the next level.

### Disable ALL building level changes (optional)
This can be toggled in the mod's options panel (the default is **off**).  When this is enabled all growable buildings will keep their current level, ensuring that they also keep their appearance.

Note that builing level-up progress within the current level will still show on the building's level up progress panel, but it will never reach the level required to upgrade to the next level.

## How to select and place growable building
This mod doesn't have its own UI - instead, use TDW's [**Find It** mod](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/77240/Windows) to select and place growable buildings (or use the game's developer mode).
